  description: >
    API for the user interface service; the service that is directly
    responsible for presenting data to users.

    This service typically runs at the border, and leverages session cookies or
    authentication tokens that we generate for users. It also is responsible
    for handling the act of oauth and user creation through its login hooks.

    uisvc typically talks to the datasvc and other services to accomplish its
    goal, it does not save anything locally or carry state.

        The tasks list returns a list of Task objects that correspond to the
        query. Each query may contain pagination or filtering rules to limit
        its contents. It is strongly recommended to look at the "count"
        equivalents for these endpoints so that you can implement pagination
        more simply.
