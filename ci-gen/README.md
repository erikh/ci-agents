## tinyCI code generation and client/service bindings

This code is the protos and swagger specifications (As well as all generated
code associated with it) for generating the GRPC and REST clients and service
bindings.

This code is produced under the MIT license so that it can be re-used more
easily than the MPL 2.0 licensed tinyCI agents.

This licensing is intended to assist with the protection of our personal
interests, as well as allow companies with strict OSS compliance policies to
use and extend it.

This is a submodule of ci-agents and most paths reflect that. Expect this to
change as soon as we get time to explore how it can be better imported into
other projects.
